Random Forest Regression Model on Insurance Charges Dataset

Worked with a partner to train predictive models using linear regression and random forest regression on an insurance charges dataset obtained from Kaggle. We utilized cross validation and various loss functions to improve and compare our models. Also completed exploratory data analysis, created data visualizations, and detected outliers on this real-world dataset. After finalizing our model, we created an interactive GUI application using TkInter and Python that takes in information and predicts whether someone is a smoker.
